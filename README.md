Analysis for the project: Epigenetic plasticity is a driver of heritable pollution tolerance in killifish 

The repository contains the analysis code associated with the manuscript "Epigenetic plasticity is a driver of heritable pollution tolerance in Fundulus heteroclitus".

## Scope
The code provided illustrates the core analytical approaches used in htis study to evaluate how environmental PAH influences DNA methylation, SNP/SNV, RNA-seq, and cis-nat
expression in PAH-sensitive and PAH-tolerant Fundulus heteroclitus. Full bioinformatic pipelines (read processing, alignment and genome assembly) are not included. 

## Data availability
Raw sequencing data are available through NCBI GEO and GenBank under accessions provided below and in our manuscript: 

 Submission: SUB15839686 
 PRJNA1381666 : Fundulus heteroclitus Genome sequencing
 SAMN54117932 : Kings_Creek_Fundulus_heteroclitus

 ## Code Availability
 Analysis scripts will be continuously updated to this repository prior to publication

 ## Notes
 This repository is intended to support transparency and reproducibility of key results. Additional scirpts are available upon request (colwelma@ohsu.edu)
