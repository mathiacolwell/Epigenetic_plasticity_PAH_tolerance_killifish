# Epigenetic plasticity PAH tolerance in killifish

The repository contains the analysis code supporting the manuscript **"Epigenetic plasticity is a driver of heritable pollution tolerance in Fundulus heteroclitus"**.

The analysis evalute how environmental exposure to polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAHs) influence epigenetic and transcriptional regulation in PAH-sensitive and PAH-tolerant killifish populations.

## Scope
This repository includes downstream analysis used to generate main results in the manuscript. Analysis include: 
- DNA methylation (long-read sequencing: global and locus-specific)
- SNP/SNV calling
- RNA-seq gene expression
- cis-nat expression
- Cross population comparisons between PAH-sensitive and PAH-tolerant killifish

**Not included:**
- Full bioinformatic pipelines for raw read processing and alignment
- Genome assembly and polishing of Kings Creek Reference Genome
